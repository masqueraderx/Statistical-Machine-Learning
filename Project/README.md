#Final Project

Our final project focuses on generative models, especially GAN, VAE and their derivative models, CGAN, DCGAN, IWVAE and etc.

We tested on MINST dataset to see these different models' performance. In document folder, there are project report and project proposal. 
In reference folder, there are some papers or slides I found online which instructs on some basic knowledge about GAN, VAE and their deritative models.
In GAN code, there are codes about GAN and CGAN.
