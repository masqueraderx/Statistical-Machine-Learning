# This section focuses on Perceptron Learnign Algorithm(PLA)

If we have a linearly separarable dataset, we can always identify a separating hyperplane to separate them.
The principle of this algorithm is the following.

* start from a guess ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\theta)
* For ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?j&space;>&space;1), iterate over the data points (in any order) 
and update
