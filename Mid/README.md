# Midterm
The Midterm is in **'ECE6254-Midtermv1.0.pdf'**. However, I just uploaded the Problem 3, the programming part.
If you are interested in the rest part (mainly mathmatical problems), please feel free to contact me.

I have to highlight that this part just programs **on the basis of math**. No just import packages. If there are 
any confusion about the principles, see **http://bloch.ece.gatech.edu/ece6254fa20/ece6254fa20_lectures.html**, my
instructor's website.

The scope contains 'KNN', 'Bayes', 'Naive Bayes', 'LDA', 'Logistic Regression' and 'Kernel Methods'. In problem3,
I almost implemented all these following the fundemental mathmatical principles. Of course, the easiest way is to
import packages from sklearn.
