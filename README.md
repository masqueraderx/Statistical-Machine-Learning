# Statistical Machine Learning

Gerogia Institute of Technology ECE 6254 course. Refer to http://bloch.ece.gatech.edu/ece6254fa20/ece6254fa20_lectures.html
if you are interested in mathmatical theory. Note that it's my instructor(**Matthieu Bloch**)'s website. And I run it on JupyterLab on MAC OS.

This file includes homework, of course includes some codes beyond the homework(Other visualization of machine learning), and I
will keep updating it about some mathmatical theories about machine learning.

The mainly contains some **realization of mathmatical theories** about machine learning. The contents are as follows,
## Supervised Learning
* KNN
* Bayes
* Naive Bayes (use Bag of Words)
* LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)
* Numerical Calculation (GD, Newton's Method, SGD)
* Logistic Regression
* PLA
* Convex Optimization (KKT conditions, Dual and Primal Problems, Lagrangian)
* SVM
* VC Dimension
* Regression (Regularization)
* Bias and Variance
* Cross Validation

## Dimensionality Reduction
* Filter Methods
* Fisher LDA
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)
* Isomap Feature Mapping
* Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)

## Unsupervised Learning
* K-Means
* GMM (EM-Algorithm)

Note that in order to see README.md clearly(Generally speaking, mathmatical formula), I strongly suggest you to use **Chrome** and install the 
Chrome extension **'MathJax'**, the link for installation is here
