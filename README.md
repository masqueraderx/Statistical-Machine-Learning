# Statistical Machine Learning

Gerogia Institute of Technology ECE 6254 course. Refer to http://bloch.ece.gatech.edu/ece6254fa20/ece6254fa20_lectures.html
if you are interested in mathmatical theory. Note that it's my instructor's website.

This file includes homework, of course includes some codes beyond the homework(Other visualization of machine learning), and I
will keep updating it about some mathmatical theories about machine learning.

The mainly contains some **realization of mathmatical theories** about machine learning. The contents are as follows,
## Supervised Learning
* KNN
* Bayes
* Naive Bayes (use Bag of Words)
* LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)
* Logistic Regression
* PLA
* SVM

## Regression
* Ridge Regression
* Regularization
